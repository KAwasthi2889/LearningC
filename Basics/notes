scanf only stores one charecter till space.
fgets stores a line of input in a single variable.
fgets(<variable>, <num>, stdin) specifies fgets the number of charecters it can store at maximum.
    
char <variable> is charecter data type and can only store 1 charecter within ''.
Its sign is %c.

char <variable>[] is string data type and can store many charecters wirhin "".
char <variable>[<num>] specifies the number of charecters in the string if it is not initialised.
Its sign is %s. For string, scanf dosen't need & and printf dosen't need [].

Decimal numbers can be obtained using float and double data type.
But the input numbers must also have decimal.
Their sign is %f for printf and %f in scanf for float and %lf for double.

int <variable>[] = {1, 2, 3, 4} is an int array with 4 elements.
Here 1 has index 0, 2 has index 1 and so on.
So <variable>[3] will call the 4th element of that array.

pow(a, b) gives a^b.
sqrt(a) gives square root of a.
ceil(35.34) gives 36 as it rounds off the decimal number higher.
floor(35.34) give 35 as it rounds off the decimal number lower.

const before a variable prevents it from changing value.
const int NUM = 8; sets NUM to always be 8.
